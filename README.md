# AVA---Avinx-Virtual-Assistant - A COLLABORATION
(*Note: This is not my idea or my brainchild.) I was approached by a friend a month ago to build the interface for his project, a virtual assistant named AVA (short for 'Avinx Virtual Assistant'). This is a progress I've made to making her a reality. You can check out his page and other works at https://github.com/56radius. 

It is also worth noting that this is subject to change later in the near future, as this project will come closer and closer to the final 'completed' project. These are merely the first drafts that I'm sharing with you and there's definitely plenty of work to be done.

AVA is AI. The main aim is to help users (or people) struggling with their mental healths and depression. This could be by being a shoulder to lean on, or an emotionally available friend to talk to. She can also refer people to hospitals for further healthcare and treatments, and has access to user's basic medical history and details to be able to try to diagnose a user based on their past ailments and current symptoms. The fact that she is AI simply means that the possibilities are technically endless, but she just needs to be developed on properly. The initial owner of this project (56radius) owns all the rights and will be handling the frontend and backend programming for AVA- I recommend checking out his page!

Anticipate the finished project.
