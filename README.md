# AVA---Avinx-Virtual-Assistant
(*Note: This is not my idea or my brainchild.) I was approached by a friend a month ago to build the interface for his project, a virtual assistant named AVA (short for 'Avinx Virtual Assistant'. This is a progress I've made to making her a reality. You can check out his page and other works at https://github.com/56radius.
